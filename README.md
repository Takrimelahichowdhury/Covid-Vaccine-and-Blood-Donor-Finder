# Covid-Vaccine-and-Blood-Donor-Finder
This is the very fast project of my university life in Algorithm course. In this project I used C++ language.
The project idea was to create a blood finder according to the patient blood. In this project, we also create a system for digital covid vaccination.
A consolebase software that handles all the data related to vaccination and blood donation. The data contains the name of the persons who have taken the vaccine and also tells the current status of vaccine availability. Previously the task of handling the vaccination data was very difficult, so there was a need for software that can handle all the vaccination data. However it can help with blood bag information while it is being handled in the blood bank. Every patient should be able to access an adequate supply of safe blood at their location thanks to an effective blood bank management system. The management system can address the issue of blood demand and wastage, resulting in self-sufficiency in blood supply.
